#A python wrapper for Survey Gizmo's API (v4)
# depends on requests, ruath (for oauth handling) or you can just use your api_key and token from gizmo's admin page.
# optionally, you can integrate with slack and uncomment stuff for that, and there are obvious places where using a mysql database 
# to handle fetched keys would help.
